# Movie Recommendation System üé¨

A movie recommendation system is a type of recommendation engine specifically designed to suggest films to users based on their past viewing habits, preferences, and other relevant data. Such systems are integral to streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they aim to provide personalized content to increase user engagement and satisfaction.

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built with the TMDb 5000 Movies and Credits datasets. It processes and combines movie metadata, including genres, keywords, cast, crew, production companies, and overview descriptions, to recommend movies based on similarity.
### Types of Recommendation Approaches

There are three primary approaches for a movie recommendation system:

1.  **Content-Based Filtering**:
    
    -   **How It Works**: Content-based filtering recommends movies similar to those a user has liked or interacted with in the past. This is achieved by analyzing movie metadata (such as genre, cast, director) and matching it with user preferences.
    -   **Advantages**: No dependence on other users‚Äô data; good for niche items. Works well even with new or infrequent users if enough metadata is available.
    -   **Limitations**: Limited to known preferences and metadata, often leading to recommendations that lack variety or novelty.
    -   **Example Techniques**:
        -   **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**: Compute similarity between movies based on their metadata.
        -   **Word Embeddings**: Represent words or metadata as vectors in a continuous vector space, making it possible to compute more nuanced similarities.
2.  **Collaborative Filtering**:
    
    -   **How It Works**: Collaborative filtering bases its recommendations on user-item interactions across the entire user base. There are two main types:
        -   **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on users with similar viewing patterns.
        -   **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked or interacted with.
    -   **Advantages**: Can uncover hidden patterns and recommend diverse content by leveraging user similarity.
    -   **Limitations**: Requires a substantial amount of user interaction data; struggles with the ‚Äúcold start‚Äù problem for new users or movies.
    -   **Example Techniques**:
        -   **Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors representing user preferences and movie attributes.
        -   **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**: Optimizes user and item matrices to predict missing values in the user-item matrix.
3.  **Hybrid Approaches**:
    
    -   **How It Works**: Hybrid methods combine both content-based and collaborative filtering to achieve better accuracy and cover each technique's weaknesses.
    -   **Types of Hybrids**:
        -   **Weighted Hybrid**: A weighted average of content and collaborative scores for each recommendation.
        -   **Switching Hybrid**: Switches between methods based on criteria like user activity or availability of metadata.
        -   **Meta-Level Hybrid**: Uses the output of one recommender as input for another.
    -   **Advantages**: Greater personalization and diversity, ability to balance recommendation novelty with relevance.
    -   **Limitations**: More complex to implement and computationally intensive.
    -   **Example Techniques**:
        -   **Deep Learning Models**: Neural Collaborative Filtering, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential recommendations, or transformers to capture more sophisticated patterns in user-item interactions.
In this Project we have developed Content filtering based Movie Recommendation System

Content-Based filtering doesn‚Äôt involve other users, but based on our preference, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content to generate recommendations for us.

#### TF-IDF Vectorizer
**TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a commonly used text vectorization technique in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval to represent documents and words in a way that highlights the most important words in each document within a corpus. It measures the relevance of a term in a document by balancing two factors:

1.  **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a word appears in a document. A higher count increases the word's relevance within that document. For term ttt in document ddd, TF is calculated as:
    
  TF(t,d)=Total number of terms in d/Number of times t appears in d‚Äã
  
2.  **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How common or rare a word is across the entire corpus of documents. Words that appear in many documents have lower IDF scores, while unique words have higher scores, helping to identify terms that are particularly significant to certain documents. For term t in a corpus of N documents where df‚Äã documents contain the term t:
    
   IDF(t)=log(N/df‚Äã+1‚Äã)
    
    Adding 1 to df‚Äã avoids division by zero.
    

### TF-IDF Calculation

The final **TF-IDF score** for a term in a document is the product of the term‚Äôs TF and IDF scores:

TF-IDF(t,d)=TF(t,d)√óIDF(t)

**Cosine Similarity**

Cosine Similarity can be defined as a method to measure the difference between two non-zero vectors. In our case, the film title and the key movie features represent the coordinates of a movie vector. Thus, in order to calculate the similarity between the two movies, if we know the film title and key features of both the movies, we just need to calculate the difference between the two movie vectors.

The cosine similarity formula can be mathematically described as shown below.

    plaintext
    
    Copy code
    
    `API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key`
## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are:

2.  **Clean Data**: Removes missing values and duplicates.
3.  **Feature Engineering**:
    -   Extracts and processes fields like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and production companies.
    -   Combines these features into a single `tags` column for easier vectorization.
4.  **Text Processing**:
    -   Stemming: Reduces words to their root forms for consistency.
    -   Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF on the `tags` field to create a matrix of features.
5.  **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates cosine similarity between movies to find the most similar movies for recommendations.


### Key Data Processing Functions

-   `convert_list`: Extracts names from JSON-like fields for genres and keywords.
-   `convert_top3`: Extracts the top 3 entries for cast and production companies.
-   `fetch_director`: Extracts director information from the crew.

2.  **Sparse Matrix**: Only the top 10 similar movies are retained for efficiency.
3.  **Recommendation Function**: Returns the titles and posters of the top 9 most similar movies.
3.  **Saving Model**: The processed data (`movie_dict.pkl`) and similarity matrix (`sparse_cosine_sim.pkl`) are saved for future use.
